# Machine Readable Word Lists

Unfortunately, a lot of the word lists that are available on line are not in
structured machine readable format (eg, some are pdfs, others are in html).

This is a collection of those lists converted into `.yml` and `.json`, so they
can be readily consumed and manipulated by computers.

## Word Lists

### Academic

*University Word List (UWL)*

An 836-item academic vocabulary list that compiles academic English common to a variety of disciplines but excluded from the GSL. Especially useful for academic reading and provides on average some 8.5% coverage of academic texts (Nation & Waring, 1997). Divided into 11 sublists based on frequency.

*Academic Word List (AWL)*

A general-purposes academic word list, particularly for reading, with 570 word families that are not included in the GSL but that have wide range in academic texts, across disciplines (based on corpus research in arts, commerce, law, and science). Further divided into 10 sublists that reflect frequency and range.

*Academic Keyword List (AKL)*

930 potentially academic words which are listed into nouns, verbs, adjectivies, adverbs and others. The AKL differs from Coxhead’s Academic Word List as it includes high frequency words (e.g. aim, argue, because, compare, explain, namely, result) shown to play an essential structuring role in academic prose.

*Academic Vocabulary List (AVL)*

Based on 120 million word academic texts in Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA). Compared to AWL is based on more recent texts, has more coverage and more information regarding word families. Sub-genres include History, Education, Law & Political Science, Social Science, Humanities, Philosophy, Religion, Psychology, Science & Technology, Medicine & Health, Business & Finance.

*Academic Vocabulary List - Shared Disciplines*

The AVL (Academic Vocabulary List, 2013) was reduced to 427 lemmas ordered by part of speech and frequency. The BAWE (British Academic Written Corpus) was used to check for coverage of the AVL. The list uses a cut off of at least 12 per million with coverage in at least 90% of the disciplines in BAWE. Disciplines: Economics, Business, Sociology, Politics, Psychology, Cybernetics & Electronic Engineering, Architecture, Linguistics, Anthropology, Hotel, Leisure & Tourism Management, Engineering, Computer Science Meteorology, Health, Law, Philosophy, Agriculture, Planning, Archaeology, Mathematics, History, Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Physics, Food Sciences, Contemporary American Studies, English, Publishing, Medicine, Classics.

*General Science Jargon List*

12,000 articles were selected (biomedical and life sciences) to identify words frequently used in the scientific literature. In order to avoid any recency bias, 2,000 articles were randomly selected from six different decades (starting at the 1960s). From these articles, the frequency of all words was calculated. These are non-subject-specific words that are frequently used by scientists. This list contains words with a variety of different linguistic functions. General science jargon can be considered the basic vocabulary of a 'science-ese'. Science-ese is analogous to legalese, which is the general technical language used by legal professionals.

*Academic Vocabulary for Middle School Students*

The Middle School Content-Area Textbook Corpus (MS-CAT) consists of 109 content-area textbooks designed for sixth, seventh or eighth graders in US public schools. The total word count is over 18 million words. There are five subject area sub-corpora: English grammar and writing, health, math, science, and social studies and history. Literature and reading material is not included in the English corpus. To build the five MS-CAT lists, the GSL 1000 and 2000 families were excluded. Both AWL words and non-AWL words which reached certain frequencies were included. Each sub list is about 400 words.
